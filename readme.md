TSLint configurations for alwaysAI projects

## Usage

These instructions assume that you're already using TypeScript and are now just adding `tslint`.

Use `npm` or `yarn` to install this package:
```
npm install --save-dev tslint @alwaysai/tslint-config
```

Create a file `tslint.json` at the root of your project with contents:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "@alwaysai/tslint-config"
  ]
}
```
That tells TSLint to use the "main" export of this package, [its `tslint.json`](tslint.json) file. Add these lines to your `package.json`'s "scripts" field:
```
    "lint": "tslint --project .",
    "lint:fix": "npm run lint -- --fix",
```
Finally add `&& npm run lint` to your package's "test" script to make sure you don't forget to lint! I strongly recommend setting up your editor to automatically fix lint errors on save. That makes it so that the linter mostly stays out of your way. In Visual Studio Code, [this plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) works great.

## Rules
This package's rules extend those espoused by [by AirBnB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), consumed as [tslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint-config-airbnb). Those rules are mostly concerned with syntax. For code formatting, this package uses [`tslint-config-prettier`](https://github.com/alexjoverm/tslint-config-prettier), which disables all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) in conjunction with [`tslint-plugin-prettier`](https://github.com/ikatyang/tslint-plugin-prettier), which "runs Prettier as a TSLint rule and reports differences as individual TSLint issues". I wrote up some thoughts [here](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-node/issues/2842#issuecomment-425229710) on why that's a much better approach than using `tslint` and `prettier` separately. Finally this configuration also enables the [dtslint "expect" rule](https://github.com/Microsoft/dtslint/blob/4539c93657ea93e96eff84aa835422f6eed3e3b7/src/rules/expectRule.ts), which allows you to make type assertions that are checked at the same time as the lint rules:

```ts
// $ExpectType "foo"
'foo';

// $ExpectType string[]
['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];
```
These are a nice way of writing programmatic tests for types beyond what you can achieve with unit testing alone.
